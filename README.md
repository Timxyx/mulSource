### Prerequisits:
- make sure your have the gcc compiler installed
- I only ensure the functionality on WSL-Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS 

## Setup Guide

- Start by cloning the repository into a directory of your choosing.
- Type following commands into your terminal

```
mkdir build && cd build
```
followed by
```
cmake ..
```

### Now you are all set up and ready to go

to compile the code just type `make` inside of the build folder

and run everything with:
```
./mulsource
```
